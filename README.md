# Create-Gestalt-Figures
This code creates a strip with black and white convex and concave objects

The script MakeGestaltFigures.m contains the code that creates the objects.
The objects are presented to you via Cogent, and screenshots of the objects are made and saved.
Adjust the script so that you know where the screenshots are saved

The folder 'dependencies' contains all the necessary functions and the software 'Cogent' that is used.
